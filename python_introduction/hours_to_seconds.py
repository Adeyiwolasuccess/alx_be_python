# Define the number of hours
hours = 2

# Calculate the number of seconds
# There are 3600 seconds in an hour (60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute)
seconds_in_an_hour = 3600
seconds = hours * seconds_in_an_hour

# Print the result
# Expected format: [hours] hour(s) is [seconds] seconds.
print(f"{hours} hour(s) is {seconds} seconds.")
